Dear Developer:

  This sample driver may be modified, given away, sold or whatever as long
  as any Apple Computer, Inc. copyright notices remain intact and that the
  modified driver is intended for an A/UX-licensed user.

The contents of this directory:

  Makefile		Builds, Installs and Configures the whole thing.
  Makefile.Deps		Contains the 'make' dependency information for sample.
  README		This file.
  sample.c		The sample driver.  Play with it and have fun!
  conf			Configuration files are stored here.
    hw_slots.c		Special program to figure out active hardware slots.
    conf/init		Module Initialization script.
    conf/install	Module Installation script.
    conf/master		Module Master file.
    conf/startup	Module Startup script.
    conf/uninstall	Module Un-Install script.

This sample driver doesn't require a hardware board in order to work, but if
you do decide to use a board with this driver, you WILL need to make some
changes (the driver can't possibly know how your board works!).
Because this driver is configured as a "slots" driver (so you can see the
process of installing it), we have to build a 'loadfile' with the slot
information for each board (or pseudo-board as is our case) so that the
autoconfig command will load in our driver; this is done for you automatically.

You can compile the driver as a normal user, but to install the configuration
files needed by newunix(1M) command and to do the autoconfiguration with the
autoconfig(1M) command will require that you become root (super-user).

This sample driver is an exact copy of the sample driver listed in the
"Building A/UX Device Driver" book, Chapter 14.  Enjoy!
